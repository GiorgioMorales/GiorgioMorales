### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Giorgio L. Morales Luna. I am a researcher specializing in Symbolic Regression, Explainable and Interpretable Machine Learning, and Uncertainty Quantification. I earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science at Montana State University under the supervision of Dr. John Sheppard, as a member of the Numerical Intelligent Systems Laboratory (NISL). I hold an M.S. in Computer Science from Montana State University and a B.S. in Mechatronic Engineering from the National University of Engineering in Peru. My research aims to advance transparent machine learning techniques that support scientific discovery, decision-making under uncertainty, and data-driven exploration across disciplines such as physics, biodiversity, and engineering.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at the [GREYC Laboratory](https://www.greyc.fr/en/laboratory/).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Uncertainty Quantification in Generative Models.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him/his.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Birds are real.
